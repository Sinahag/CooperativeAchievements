This is the third and final iteration of the cooperative game record holder. It is able to take and store
photos, calculate all individual players, show achievement celebrations, and show statistics about games

README:
* For the achievement statistics for viewing how many times you earned each achievement level
* we introduced a new library to have some extra UI elements. All the calculation was done outside
* and the library was only used to showcase the data that we input into it.
* The library we used was MPAndroidChart and we followed this tutorial "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL8VyvLJ2d8"
* The link to the library that was used in Android Studio is "com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v3.1.0"
* Again all the library does is that it takes in the x and y values and makes it into a bar graph for viewing pleasure
