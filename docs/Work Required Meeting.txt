"Team must estimate the work required for 5-6 user stores"
Brief description of the user story
The estimated amount of work
Included a mention of what your team used as a unit of 1 work

    - Define a unit of work as 1 unit being as difficult as implementing the most basic user story in the project, with the points being multitude harder than the most basic user story
        ○ The difficulty will be based on how hard it was implementing the help page in iteration 1
            § This will be the help screen of iteration 1

    - Game play difficulty
        ○ Description:
            § Each time I play a game, I want to be able to select a difficulty level for that specific game play.
        ○ We think that it will be 6-8x as hard as the help screen
        ○ So 6-8 work units

    - Achievement Celebration
        ○ Description:
            § When a game is played and an achievement level is earned, I want an image, some animation effect, and a sound to be played to make it feel like a reward and a celebration.
        ○ We think implementing an image, animation, and sound for each achievement level will be strenuous
        ○ So 7 work units

    - Achievement Theme
        ○ Description:
            § I want to select a theme for the achievements. I want at least 3 different themes to choose between
        ○ 20 work units, LOTS of stuff to change and do

    -  Edit game played
        ○ Description:
            § When viewing a previous game play, I'd like to be able to edit it to correct any errors, such as changing scores or difficulty so that I can correct any errors from previous game plays.
        ○ 10 work units, adjusting current code to be able to edit

    - Friendly UI
        ○ Description:
            § Make the UI friendly and good looking so that it is more appealing to use. ("Make it look like it's our first app made")
        ○ Need to update all of the UI, 30 work units

    - Score Calculator
        ○ Description:
            § When recording a game play, change the screen to allow the user to enter each player's score individually so that I don't have to add it up in my head when I'm playing with multiple players.
        ○ Lots of stuff needing to change or adjust to accept multiple players. Need to change model for calculation
        ○ 25 work units
